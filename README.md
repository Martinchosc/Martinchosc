# üíª Martincho

**`Junior on Software & AI Engineer (Developer/Scripter)`**

I am a part-time developer and leading robotics developer worldwide. I have a track record of 10 years working in the field of robotics competing nationally and globally, representing Argentina and coming out top 5. My role in these jobs has always been programming, so I have handled several languages, I know both the electronics and the software.

Right now I'm a student at UDESA university but right now I'm on a scholarship at Standford University, studying AI and Software Engineering. Despite this I have decided in my free time to dedicate myself to the roblox videogame market and apply all my knowledge of logic and programming to the game's graphic engine.

I've been learning how roblox studio works, how to store in an optimized way the codes and how each module works in between in this last year and so right now I'm creating this portofolio to start with, so the projects I've done are my own. I simply focus on the game being safe and having a structured logic so that anyone in the development team can understand it.

## ‚ùì Q/A
**¬øHow much time do I have to devote to a project?**

Currently with university timetables I can dedicate between 2 or 3 hours a day to the projects I am working on, depending on the week. During exam week I will not be working, I hope you understand that.

In the case of a large project that has an upgrade plan and a developed team, I may have special considerations to dedicate more time to it.

**¬øWhat about teamwork?**

Right now I've been trying to implement Visual Studio Code with Roblox Studio to be able to work with Git so that the work of a team stays organised and we can log every change that is made to the game. So I consider that teamwork is not a problem.

**¬øPayment methods?**

Accepted payment methods are exclusively PayPal and Robux.

My professional workflow is structured to ensure client satisfaction and transparency. I will first complete the commissioned work in a timely manner. Upon completion, I will provide a comprehensive video demonstration showcasing the full functionality of the project; the code itself will be thoroughly documented with docstrings for clarity. Once you have reviewed the demonstration and are fully satisfied with the results, we will proceed with the payment. The complete project files will be delivered to you immediately after the transaction is processed. Finally, subsequent to delivery, I may formally request your permission to feature the work in my public portfolio on GitHub, and the project will only be made public with your explicit consent.
